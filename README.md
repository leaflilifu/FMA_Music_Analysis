## Project Motivation and Overview:  
As the music industry and streaming services become increasingly competitive, understanding what attracts users to listen frequently is essential. By evaluating the correlation between music features and listening counts, we can discover key elements that encourage user engagement. These insights can help the music industry and streaming platforms boost their popularity.

This report presents an exploratory analysis of music track popularity using data from the Free Music Archive (FMA). Our project focuses on four hypotheses to examine whether language, duration, genre, and social features impact a song's popularity, measured by track listens. 

We begin by detailing the data cleaning and merging process for the three main datasets: tracks, audio features, and genres. Following this, we use data visualizations to provide an overview of the dataset and analyze the correlation between audio features and the number of listens. The report concludes with a summary of our findings, challenges encountered, future analysis suggestions, and references.

## Key Findings:
- **Pure music (tracks without lyrics)** generally received higher listens compared to tracks with vocals, indicating a strong audience preference for instrumental tracks.
- **Track duration** had no strong correlation with popularity, suggesting that both short and long tracks can perform well.
- **Genre distribution and track characteristics** revealed distinct patterns between different genres, such as higher danceability for Electronic and Rock genres.
- **Audio feature analysis** showed no clear linear correlation with track listens, suggesting the need for more sophisticated regression analysis using machine learning techniques.
- **Social factors**, such as artist recognition and song popularity, were positively associated with track listens, emphasizing the importance of social engagement in driving track success.

## Conclusion:
Our analysis highlights several factors influencing track popularity, though further research is required to establish stronger predictive models. Future work could explore more advanced machine learning techniques to better capture the complexities of the relationships between audio features and song popularity.
